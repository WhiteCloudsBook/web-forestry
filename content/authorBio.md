My name is Yoav Niran, and I’m a 37-year-old front-end developer from Israel. I’m a husband, dad, basketball junky, recovering Futurama addict, and now also a debuting author.

I’ve always loved to write. I wrote mostly poems from an early age, that filled up my virtual drawer. I kept imagining what it would be like to write a novel, especially a science fiction one, but never pursued it further.

Then came the idea for the White Clouds story. It got lodged in my brain for years, never really going away. Nesting there for a long while until I decided it was high time to put fingers to keyboard and actually write.

For the last few years, I’ve worked on White Clouds and now feel it’s ready for the world to read. Here’s hoping the world is also game.

Surprisingly, my love for writing did not subside upon completion of my first novel. And so while working 80% in my day job (building web apps), I’m now starting on a new novel, set in a different universe. More on that soon.
