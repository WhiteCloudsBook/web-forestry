book_blurb: "<p>Five centuries after a fraction of humanity left a dying Earth behind
  - humans dwell aboard giant space stations called <strong>CLOUDS</strong>.</p><p>What
  starts as a typical day for <strong>WENDALL SYING</strong> turns into a nightmare
  when his mom is discovered dead at home. With no time to mourn, Wendall leaves everything
  behind to follow his mother's instructions left in a recording she made for him.
  In it, she reveals that she was part of a vigilance group with the sole purpose
  of preventing a sentient AI from rising again. When last encountered, this AI had
  killed tens of thousands.</p><p>The people behind the attempt to resurrect the AI
  are coming for Wendall. They need him, not for what he can do or what he knows but
  for what he is. The AI's source code has fused into his DNA, passed on to him as
  a result of an accident involving a distant ancestor. With him, They'd be able to
  fulfill their plan to instate this AI entity as humanity's ruler.</p><p>After his
  pursuers kill a friend sent to help him reach safety, Wendall is all alone. Now,
  he has to decide much more than his fate. If he runs, his pursuers will no doubt
  hurt more of his friends. If he fights and falls into their hands, the AI would
  be unstoppable. According to the Vigilance, setting it loose on the Clouds could
  only mean one thing - <strong>Annihilation</strong>.</p><p>Either way, Wendall has
  no choice but to confront what he cannot outrun - The part of the AI that's inside
  him.</p>"
