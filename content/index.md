  <p> Five centuries after a fraction of humanity left a dying Earth behind - humans dwell aboard giant space stations called <strong>CLOUDS</strong>. </p>
  <p> On one such cloud, a typical day for <strong>WENDALL SYING</strong> turns into a nightmare when security forces find his mother dead at home. All signs point to suicide. Yet a recording his mom left him tells a very different story. </p>
  <p> Now, Wendall has to leave everything behind to follow his mother’s instructions. In her recording she reveals she was part of a secret group with the sole purpose of preventing a sentient AI from rising again. When last encountered, this AI had killed tens of thousands. </p>
  <p> The cult attempting to resurrect the AI are hunting Wendall. They need him, not for what he can do or what he knows but for <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>what he is</span>. The AI’s source code fused into his DNA, a result of an accident generations old. With this code, They’d be able to fulfill their plan to instate the AI entity as humanity’s ruler. </p>

If he fights and falls into their hands, the AI would be unstoppable. According to his mom, setting it loose on the Clouds could only mean one thing - <strong>Annihilation</strong>. </p>
  <p> Wendall's only choice is stop this cult. To do so he must confront what he cannot outrun - <em>The part of the AI that’s inside him</em>. </p>
