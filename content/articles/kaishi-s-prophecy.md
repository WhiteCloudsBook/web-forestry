<h3 style="font-style: italic; font-size: 12px;">From the story...</h3>
</p>

<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">

At a time calculated by the star dwellers

From the garden of hidden truths to the vacuum of absolutes

The face of shadow will be the harbinger of what’s to come

A true intelligence will seek out from the cold

It will challenge the natural continuation

brink of destruction will be reached

The voyage forward shan’t be interrupted 

The link must be formed

The union of the child must be complete
