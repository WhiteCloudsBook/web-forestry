_At a time calculated by the star dwellers_

_From the garden of hidden truths to the vacuum of absolutes_

_The face of shadow will be the harbinger of what’s to come_

_A true intelligence will seek out from the cold_

_It will challenge the natural continuation_ 

_brink of destruction will be reached_

_The voyage forward shan’t be interrupted_ 

_The link must be formed_

_The union of the child must be complete_
