<h3 style="font-style: italic; font-size: 12px;">From the story...</h3>
</p>

<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">

♫ In darkness we sprouted
<br/>
along narrow ways we shouted
<br/>
nothing we didn’t dare do
<br/>
all of our fears we outgrew


We rejoiced in exile below
<br/> 
alive with our faces aglow
<br/>
poor but we were free
<br/>
the truth we could see


We are small marvels
<br/>
the forgotten horde
<br/>
we ran like devils
<br/>
our stories forever untold

Our songs rang these walls
<br/>
fire burnt in our souls
<br/>
we vowed to stay together
<br/>
to always remember

We are small marvels… ♫
