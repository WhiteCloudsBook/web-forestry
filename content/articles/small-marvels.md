<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">

 Small Marvels
♫ In darkness we sprouted
along narrow ways we shouted
nothing we didn’t dare do
all of our fears we outgrew
We rejoiced in exile below 
alive with our faces aglow
poor but we were free
the truth we could see
We are small marvels
the forgotten horde
we ran like devils
our stories forever untold
Our songs rang these walls
fire burnt in our souls
we vowed to stay together
to always remember
We are small marvels… ♫
